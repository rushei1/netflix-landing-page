# netflix-landing-page

I created a clone of Netflix's login page as a personal project, utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to hone my web development skills while gaining a deeper understanding of front-end development.

In HTML, I structured the page with input fields for email, along with a login button. CSS was used to replicate Netflix's distinctive design, ensuring that fonts, colors, and layout closely resembled the original page. To enhance user experience, I implemented responsive design to make the clone adaptable to various screen sizes.

JavaScript played a crucial role in adding functionality to the login page. I employed some basic animations to make the page more engaging.

This project not only showcased my web development abilities but also provided valuable experience in creating user-friendly interfaces. It's a testament to my dedication to learning and my passion for web development as a CSE student.
